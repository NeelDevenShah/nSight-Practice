Before making or analysis the report in the any of the system , make sure that the nvdia cuda tool kit is already installed, otherwise report will not be generated.

In this hackathon, we have used the slrum, cuda, nsight compute, nsight systems

For puting the file in the job
sbatch three-minds.sh

For checking the job that is running
squeue -u ext28

For making the new environment in the python
python -m venv myenv


For activating the environment ->   scource /scratch/three-minds/workstation/pythonenvs/env2-python37/env2-lbtv/bin/activate

Report path

Two types of the systems -> DGX and cluster
DGX -> All the gpus are connected together, there are no different ports 
cluster -> There are different ports for GPU


CUDA
Qunatum computing
